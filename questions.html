    <p>1. What is Web 2.0? How does it differ from Web 1.0? Web 2,0 is the second stage of development of the World Wide Web.
    Web 1.0 is mostly for browsing content while Web 2.0 allows for more tasks<p>

<p> 2.There is no simple definition of Web 2.0 because the meaning, or what we think is the meaning, is constantly changing.</p>
<p>3.Name and briefly define three common Web 2.0 Architecture Patterns.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Software as a Service (SaaS):  No longer are users required to install program on to their systems to perform certain tasks.</li>
  <li>The Synchronized Web: Web interactions are merging together to perform tasks that were once done separately.</li>
  <li>Mashup: Using two different information sources to merge and make one useful source. </li>
</ol>
<p>4.Give an example of an online architectural pattern. Explain why you chose that pattern
YouTube’s structure is an example of an online architectural pattern. I chose this pattern because most web users today visit this site frequently.</p>
<p>5.What is Forensic Architecture? Forensic Architecture is the utilization of the architecture for something after it’s has been completed.</p>
<p>6.How do the authors define open standards (name four points)? Open standards, defined by the authors, are defined as web standards that are not controlled by any one private entity, are developed by organizations that are operating with an open and transparent process, are not encumbered by any patents or other intellectual property claims that result in unfair distribution of the ability to implement them (commercial or noncommercial), and are designed to benefit the who community of users rather than one specific subset of users for financial or other gains.</p>
<p>7.How do the authors define HTTP? They define HTTP as a text-based messaging protocol that depends on TCP/IP and handles the actions required for web browsers to interact with web resources.</p>
